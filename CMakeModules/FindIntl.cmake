# FindIntl
# --------
#
# Find the Gettext libintl headers and libraries.
#
# This module reports information about the Gettext libintl
# installation in several variables.  General variables::
#
#   INTL_FOUND - true if the libintl headers and libraries were found
#   INTL_INCLUDE_DIRS - the directory containing the libintl headers
#   INTL_LIBRARIES - libintl libraries to be linked
#
# The following cache variables may also be set::
#
#   INTL_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the libintl headers
#   INTL_LIBRARY - the libintl library (if any)
#
# .. note::
#   On some platforms, such as Linux with GNU libc, the gettext
#   functions are present in the C standard library and libintl
#   is not required.  ``INTL_LIBRARIES`` will be empty in this
#   case.
#
# .. note::
#   If you wish to use the Gettext tools (``msgmerge``,
#   ``msgfmt``, etc.), use :module:`FindGettext`.
